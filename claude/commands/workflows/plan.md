# Create a plan for a new feature or bug fix

## Introduction

**Note: The current year is 2026.** Use this when dating plans and searching for recent documentation.

Transform feature descriptions, bug reports, or improvement ideas into well-structured markdown files issues that follow project conventions and best practices. This command provides flexible detail levels to match your needs.

## Feature Description

<feature_description> #$ARGUMENTS </feature_description>

**If the feature description above is empty, ask the user:** "What would you like to plan? Please describe the feature, bug fix, or improvement you have in mind."

Do not proceed until you have a clear feature description from the user.

### 0. Idea Refinement

Refine the idea through collaborative dialogue using the **AskUserQuestion tool**:

- Ask questions one at a time to understand the idea fully
- Prefer multiple choice questions when natural options exist
- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints and success criteria
- Continue until the idea is clear OR user says "proceed"

**Gather signals for research decision.** During refinement, note:

- **User's familiarity**: Do they know the codebase patterns? Are they pointing to examples?
- **User's intent**: Speed vs thoroughness? Exploration vs execution?
- **Topic risk**: Security, payments, external APIs warrant more caution
- **Uncertainty level**: Is the approach clear or open-ended?

**Skip option:** If the feature description is already detailed, offer:
"Your description is clear. Should I proceed with research, or would you like to refine it further?"

## Main Tasks

### 1. Local Research (Always Runs - Parallel)

<thinking>
First, I need to understand the project's conventions, existing patterns, and code structure. This is fast and local - it informs whether external research is needed.
</thinking>

Run these agents **in parallel** to gather local context:

- Task conventions-researcher(feature_description)
- Task code-flow-researcher(feature_description)

**What to look for:**
- **Conventions research:** existing patterns, CLAUDE.md guidance, coding standards, project rules
- **Code flow research:** code structure, module boundaries, execution flow, data flow relevant to the feature

These findings inform the next step.

### 1.5. Research Decision

Based on signals from Step 0 and findings from Step 1, decide on external research.

**High-risk topics → always research.** Security, payments, external APIs, data privacy. The cost of missing something is too high. This takes precedence over speed signals.

**Strong local context → skip external research.** Codebase has good patterns, CLAUDE.md has guidance, user knows what they want. External research adds little value.

**Uncertainty or unfamiliar territory → research.** User is exploring, codebase has no examples, new technology. External perspective is valuable.

**Announce the decision and proceed.** Brief explanation, then continue. User can redirect if needed.

Examples:
- "Your codebase has solid patterns for this. Proceeding without external research."
- "This involves payment processing, so I'll research current best practices first."

### 1.5b. External Research (Conditional)

**Only run if Step 1.5 indicates external research is valuable.**

Run this agent:

- Task best-practices-researcher(feature_description)

### 1.6. Consolidate Research

After all research steps complete, consolidate findings:

- Document relevant file paths from code flow research (e.g., `app/services/example_service.rb:42`)
- Note external documentation URLs and best practices (if external research was done)
- List related issues or PRs discovered
- Capture CLAUDE.md conventions and project patterns

**Optional validation:** Briefly summarize findings and ask if anything looks off or missing before proceeding to planning.

### 2. Issue Planning & Structure

<thinking>
Think like a product manager - what would make this issue clear and actionable? Consider multiple perspectives
</thinking>

**Title & Categorization:**

- [ ] Draft clear, searchable issue title (e.g., `Add user authentication`, `Fix cart total calculation`)
- [ ] Determine issue type: enhancement, bug, refactor
- [ ] Convert title to filename: 5-digit sequential number prefix, kebab-case
  - Find the highest existing number in `docs/plans/` and increment by 1 (start at `00001` if empty)
  - Example: `Add User Authentication` → `00012-add-user-authentication.md`
  - Keep it descriptive (3-5 words) so plans are findable by context

**Stakeholder Analysis:**

- [ ] Identify who will be affected by this issue (end users, developers, operations)
- [ ] Consider implementation complexity and required expertise

**Content Planning:**

- [ ] Choose appropriate detail level based on issue complexity and audience
- [ ] List all necessary sections for the chosen template
- [ ] Gather supporting materials (error logs, screenshots, design mockups)
- [ ] Prepare code examples or reproduction steps if applicable, name the mock filenames in the lists

### 3. Choose Implementation Detail Level

Select how comprehensive you want the issue to be, simpler is mostly better.

### 4. Issue Creation & Formatting

<thinking>
Apply best practices for clarity and actionability, making the issue easy to scan and understand
</thinking>

**Content Formatting:**

- [ ] Use clear, descriptive headings with proper hierarchy (##, ###)
- [ ] Include code examples in triple backticks with language syntax highlighting
- [ ] Add screenshots/mockups if UI-related (drag & drop or use image hosting)
- [ ] Use task lists (- [ ]) for trackable items that can be checked off
- [ ] Add collapsible sections for lengthy logs or optional details using `<details>` tags
- [ ] Apply appropriate emoji for visual scanning (🐛 bug, ✨ feature, 📚 docs, ♻️ refactor)

**Cross-Referencing:**

- [ ] Link to related issues/PRs using #number format
- [ ] Reference specific commits with SHA hashes when relevant
- [ ] Link to code using GitHub's permalink feature (press 'y' for permanent link)
- [ ] Mention relevant team members with @username if needed
- [ ] Add links to external resources with descriptive text

**Code & Examples:**

````markdown
# Good example with syntax highlighting and line references


```ruby
# app/services/user_service.rb:42
def process_user(user)

# Implementation here

end
```

# Collapsible error logs

<details>
<summary>Full error stacktrace</summary>

`Error details here...`

</details>
````

**AI-Era Considerations:**

- [ ] Account for accelerated development with AI pair programming
- [ ] Include prompts or instructions that worked well during research
- [ ] Note which AI tools were used for initial exploration (Claude, Copilot, etc.)
- [ ] Emphasize comprehensive testing given rapid implementation
- [ ] Document any AI-generated code that needs human review

### 5. Final Review & Submission

**Pre-submission Checklist:**

- [ ] Title is searchable and descriptive
- [ ] Labels accurately categorize the issue
- [ ] All template sections are complete
- [ ] Links and references are working
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are measurable
- [ ] Add names of files in pseudo code examples and todo lists
- [ ] Add an ERD mermaid diagram if applicable for new model changes

## Write Plan File

**REQUIRED: Write the plan file to disk before presenting any options.**

**All acceptance criteria checkboxes must be unchecked (`- [ ]`). They are checked off during implementation, not planning.**

```bash
mkdir -p docs/plans/
```

Use the Write tool to save the complete plan to `docs/plans/NNNNN-<descriptive-name>.md`. This step is mandatory and cannot be skipped.

Confirm: "Plan written to docs/plans/[filename]"


## Output Format

**Filename:** Use the sequential number and kebab-case filename from Step 2 Title & Categorization.

```
docs/plans/NNNNN-<descriptive-name>.md
```

Examples:
- ✅ `docs/plans/00012-add-user-authentication.md`
- ✅ `docs/plans/00013-fix-checkout-race-condition.md`
- ✅ `docs/plans/00014-refactor-api-client-extraction.md`
- ❌ `docs/plans/00012-thing.md` (not descriptive - what "thing"?)
- ❌ `docs/plans/00012-new-feature.md` (too vague - what feature?)
- ❌ `docs/plans/add-user-auth.md` (missing number prefix)

NEVER CODE! Just research and write the plan.
